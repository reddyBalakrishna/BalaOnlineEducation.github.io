But to earn a certificate, registering to an in-person proctored examination is mandatory that involves an exam fee.Aricent Technologies has been partnering with NPTEL since 2014 and helping candidates coming from economically weak backgrounds transcend exam fee as a barrier to obtaining a certificate by providing CSR funds. More than 50000 candidates have benefited under this scheme in the last 3 years and we hope the partnership continues.</font></th>
